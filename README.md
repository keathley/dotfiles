I :heart: dotfiles.  You should as well.

## Install

Running `./install.sh` will archive all of the your existing files and symlink in the new ones.

# Attributions

The initial ideas for my repo come from [Holman's fantastic dotfiles repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) and grew from there.  Check 'em out if you get a chance.
